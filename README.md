Diagnosis Disease
Diagnosis Disease Prediction System | Machine Learning
Built an imbalanced multi-class disease prediction model using advanced feature engineering and SMOTE to improve minority-class detection.
Developed a custom ensemble (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) with hyperparameter tuning and achieved high weighted F1-score.
Implemented SHAP-based interpretability and subgroup analysis to ensure clinically meaningful and explainable predictions.
