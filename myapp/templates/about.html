            <p class="lead">An interpretable AI system for differential diagnosis.</p>
            <hr>
            <h5>🔬 Model</h5>
            <p>We use a soft‑voting ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. The model was trained on a Kaggle dataset containing 41 disease classes and 130+ symptoms.</p>
            
            <h5>⚖️ Handling Imbalance</h5>
            <p>SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling) ensures that rare diseases are well represented. Custom weighted loss further penalizes misclassifications of minority classes.</p>
            
            <h5>📖 Interpretability</h5>
            <p>We employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain individual predictions. For each result, the top contributing symptoms can be visualised – a feature coming soon.</p>
